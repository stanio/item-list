# Spring Boot with React

Backend using [Spring](https://spring.io/), frontend using
[React](https://react.dev/), packaged as
[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) application.

Rougly following
[_Use React and Spring Boot to Build a Simple CRUD App_](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2022/06/17/simple-crud-react-and-spring-boot),
but for my exploratory purposes.

## Requirements

-   JDK 17
-   Node 18 (`npm`)

Use `gradlew build` to build the application.  The `gradlew` (Gradle wrapper)
script would automatically download and use the configured Gradle version.
